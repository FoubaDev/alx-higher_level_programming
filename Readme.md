All files should satisfy the pycodestyle.
pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

##### Installation
__pip install pycodestyle__

#### Example usage and output
__pycodestyle --first filename.py__

You can also make pycodestyle.py show the source code for each error, and even the relevant text from PEP 8:

__pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testing/data/filename.py__
